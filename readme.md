# NibblePoker's Clang Goodies
Small collection of utilities and libraries for C in order to simplify some development tasks such as launch arguments
parsing and double linked lists.

## Preamble
This project is by no mean complete or exhaustive in the features it provides.<br>
It is mainly intended to provide me with a set of utilities and libraries I often use while making other applications.

While it is this way, it should still be usable in many projects that can benefit from it, and its functions' names,
signatures and behaviour should stay relatively similar as the project advances.
